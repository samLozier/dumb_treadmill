dumb_treadmill — accurate treadmill tracking without a smart treadmill.

Most treadmill apps require a smart treadmill connection or assume they can infer distance from arm swing or a phone in your pocket. That breaks on desk treadmills (no arm swing) or when your phone isn’t in your pocket. dumb_treadmill solves this by letting you set your pace so your workout is tracked accurately—no smart treadmill required.

Highlights:
- Accurate treadmill distance and pace for “dumb” treadmills
- Ideal for desk treadmills and hands-on-desk workouts
- Saves workouts directly to Apple Health
- Miles or kilometers display

Privacy-first: dumb_treadmill does not collect or share any data, uses no internet, and stores no Health data inside the app. Workouts are saved only to Apple Health.

Note: Health access is required to save workouts; without it, the core functionality is unavailable.
