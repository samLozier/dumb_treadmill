Privacy Policy
Last updated: [DATE]

dumb_treadmill does not collect, transmit, or share any data. The app does not use the internet, does not run analytics, and does not store your Health data inside the app.

Health Data
If you grant permission, the app writes treadmill workouts and related metrics only to Apple Health (HealthKit). The app reads Health data only to display your workout on your watch. No Health data is stored by the app itself, and no Health data leaves your device.

Permissions
You can deny Health access at any time in the Apple Health app. Note: the app is designed specifically to save workouts to Apple Health, so denying Health access removes the core functionality.

Data Sharing
We do not sell, share, or disclose any data to anyone. There are no third-party services or tracking SDKs.
